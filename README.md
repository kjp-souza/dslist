# DSList Back-end (Java) Project  

In January 2025 I attended an intensive course on Java, in which I learned how to develop a complete back-end project from Prof. Nelio Alves @ [DevSuperior](https://github.com/devsuperior).
I developed the **DSList** project, a platform that allows users to create a catalog of games based on various genres, such as **RPG, adventure, and sports**. Throughout this project, I learned and applied essential technologies, including:  

- **Java**  
- **Spring Boot**  
- **JPA/Hibernate**  
- **Maven**  
- **Docker Compose**  

Additionally, I gained valuable knowledge in:  

- **Web systems and client-server concepts**  
- **RESTful API standard and Spring REST project structuring**  
- **ORM and database seeding**  
- **DTO pattern and many-to-many relationships**  
- **SQL queries using Spring Data JPA**  

The project also covered **local testing, deployment with CI/CD, and CORS configuration**.
